# Space-Bench---a-spatial-database-benchmark-based-on-TPC-H

coding language:  SQL, Java

Space Bench provides these components:
1) a schema of spatial database
2) a suite of scalable generators for random spatial data (coding language: Java)
3) a set of data loading queries
4) a set of spatial queries for database performance test
The data generator suite is included in this repository as a zipped file, while the other components are provided in the doc of Thesis Boday.
